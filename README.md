## :scroll: Description

A countdown timer app that for now has a preset time to 15 seconds.
You can start or reset the time and when its less than 10 seconds left..  
you have to wrap up whatever you are doing and some animation will let you know when that happens.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context

Understanding how animation works in compose and building a beautiful UI.

Also how to propagate changes based on the current state of the timer.

This was the design I was aiming for from [Dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/10980042-Countdown-Exploration),
got the theme colors inspiration from it.
